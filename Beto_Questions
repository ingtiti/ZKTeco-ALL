Hello I'm from Mexico City and found your repo as ZKTeco user

I'm interested on your project and want to know more details on how it works.

Tell if I'm wrong:
zk.py is your code to directly connect a ZKTeco device, rigth?
ProcessManager.py is the code to retrive and upload Data and User files, rigth?
DeviceManager.py is the process to handle the entry details from users, rigth?

Why are you using win32com.client for?
Do you have english version of your PDF?
